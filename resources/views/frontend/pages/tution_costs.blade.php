                <p class="info-overlay-text">
                    Choosing a child care provider is an emotional and personal decision. You want to find a place that
                    feels like home, where your child will be safe, nurtured, and encouraged to learn and grow. Where is the
                    center? Is it safe? Are the teachers qualified? These are all important questions to ask.
                </p>

                <p class="info-overlay-text">
                    Tuition costs vary from center to center and depend on several factors. Things that impact the cost of
                    child care include: location, age of your child, days per week needed, hours of operation, and the
                    quality of the program.
                </p>

                <p class="info-overlay-text">
                    We encourage you to speak directly with a Center Director to understand your individual needs and
                    explore the options available. Every family's situation is unique, and we're here to help you find the
                    best fit.
                </p>

                <p class="info-overlay-text">
                    Talk with a local Center Director about tuition and schedule a visit by finding a Sprout Academy center
                    near you. At The Sprout Academy, children learn to read, make social and emotional advances, and reach
                    important developmental milestones—all while having fun in a safe, nurturing environment.
