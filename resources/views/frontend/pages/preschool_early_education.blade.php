                    <p>As preschoolers gain more self-esteem, they feel ready to take on the world. Our preschool program
                        enhances that confidence by providing activities to help children become problem solvers and develop
                        a love of lifelong learning.</p>
                    <p>Through independent exploration, structured activities, and hands-on learning, children develop a
                        variety of skills and knowledge in areas like early literacy, mathematics, science, Spanish and
                        social skills.</p>
                    <p>We’re proud of the work we do. In fact, The Sprout Academy creates its programs to align to the
                        highest quality learning standards that progress sequentially across six developmental domains.
